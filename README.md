# 🌿 Eleos Wellness & Rehabilitation Centre Website

A modern, responsive, and accessible website for **Eleos Wellness & Rehabilitation Centre**, built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **shadcn/ui**.

This project mirrors the structure and user experience of *Balance Rehab Clinic*, but with Eleos-specific branding, mission, and content. It is designed as a **static frontend** with scalability in mind for future backend integration.

---

## ✨ Features

* ⚡ **Next.js (App Router)** – fast, SEO-friendly, and modern React framework
* 🎨 **TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui** – clean, wellness-inspired UI with reusable components
* 🧩 **Atomic Design Architecture** – scalable component structure (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
* 📱 **Responsive Layout** – optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop
* ♿ **Accessibility First** – semantic HTML5, ARIA labels, and clear typography
* 🔍 **SEO Ready** – metadata setup for better search engine visibility
* 📄 **Static Frontend** – no backend dependencies (can later integrate booking, blog, donations, etc.)
